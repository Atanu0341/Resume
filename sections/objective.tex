I am Pranay, a third-year BCA undergrad from Kolkata - India. Currently, I am pursuing my career as a \textbf{Full Stack Web Developer} with \textbf{1+ years} of professional and freelance experience. I build interactive and functional products for the web using various technologies including React and Node.js . \textbf{Software Engineering} for me is as much about people as it is about technology which is why I also identify myself as an \textbf{Open-Source Advocate}.
